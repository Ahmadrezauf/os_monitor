_Google scholar_ id as found on [_Google scholar_](https://scholar.google.ch) after logging in.

Be aware that _Google scholar_ does **not** use DOI for unique document identification but instead
some other system not compatible to the widely used DOI's. The matching of documents 
from _Google scholar_ and documents from other resources is therefore (mostly) based on the
title of the publication. Since sometimes the titles do not completely match heuristics
are applied to find best (if any) matches. This is also the reason why the generation
of the combined data (after pressing the button *Show report*) can take some minutes.
